Hello, 

My name is Philippine, I am 21 years old and I am French. Although i was born and raised in Paris, I studied at University College of London for three years. 
My decison to come to london was not taken suddenly. Indeed, I had spent 5 years alternating between my primary/high school and a boarding school just outside Eastbourne. 
At UCL, I decided to switch from an economic background to a more scientific topic by studying the Bsc Management Science. In this program, I learned to apply data science to the common management topics and conducted analysis on the impact of disruptive technologies in several industries. I now work part time as a business developer in a Fintech startup called Spayr. It allows employees to access their salary on a daily basis and therefore reduces their poverty premium. It also helps HR limit their turnover and provides them with analytics on their employees' wellbeing. This deep dive in technology and management aroused my interest in venture capital and my goal is now to join a VC fund as an investor. To that end, I am pursuing the master in financial Analysis at London Business school, which will help me strengthen my financial modelling and understanding.

Some fun fact about me is that I used to compete in slalom and giant skiing but I now do more trekking. I am also fond of music: I took piano lessons for ten years, singing lessons for 5 years and listen to almost 4 hours of music per day.
